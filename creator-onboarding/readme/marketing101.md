# Marketing 101 

Marketing can help projects reach their widest audiences. Crypto markets are volatile, and sales are not guaranteed. One way artists achieve sustainable success can be to build an active and engaged audience. Art Blocks has a thriving community on several social media channels that is enthusiastic to engage with new artists and new projects. We encourage you to engage with this community and provide resources for doing so, as artists prepare to release their work.

## Guidelines 

Please adhere to the following guidelines for public communication prior to the launch of an Art Blocks drop:

1. For artists working on an Art Blocks project without an approved release, announce it as a "planned submission" to Art Blocks.
2. For artists with projects approved for Art Blocks release but not yet scheduled, announce it as a "planned release" on Art Blocks.
3. For artists with an Art Blocks scheduled release date, announce it as an "upcoming release" on Art Blocks.

For artists with an upcoming Curated project release, please wait to reveal the project and its Curated status until after Art Blocks has made an official announcement.

## Art Blocks Promotion Resources

### Art Blocks Presents Releases

Twitter: Every week, Art Blocks tweets links to the upcoming week’s events and releases.
Newsletter: Art Blocks announces upcoming releases via our newsletter, The Link.
Discord: The next week's releases are announced in #upcoming-projects on Discord.

### Curated Releases
Curated releases are included in the weekly Twitter roundup, newsletter, and #upcoming-projects announcement. Curated releases are also announced by the Art Team with a global ping in #community-announcements the week before release. In addition, the Art Team will publish an interview with the artist. Curated artists will have their own dedicated Discord channel on the Art Blocks server to engage with community members.

### Art Blocks Community Programming
The Art Blocks community team hosts a series of public programs to facilitate conversation around generative art, upcoming projects, and the creative coding process. All Art Blocks artists are invited to participate in these programs. If interested in joining, please send a message to the artist Discord DM and we’ll connect you with our Community Team. 

**Pre-Drop Talk**
Pre-Drop Talks take place as Twitter Spaces 15 minutes prior to the release of your project. A member of the Community Team will ask you a series of questions to help collectors get to know more about your creative process and the decisions behind your project. Pre-drop talks are announced on Twitter a few days before release, and you’ll be connected with the host of your talk after your project is announced in #upcoming-projects. Artists will receive interview questions in advance of the live show. If you do not have a Twitter account, the Community Team will explore alternative ways to host this conversation. 

## Marketing Tools for Artists

By releasing on Art Blocks, artists join a vibrant ecosystem of generative art experts and enthusiasts. Our main piece of advice for promoting your work/artist profile is to participate in the community.

### Art Blocks Discord Server

**#artist-general, #artist-tech, #artist-project-feedback**
Once artists have been accepted to release on Art Blocks, they’ll be assigned an Artist role in Discord. This is a space to get to know other artists, ask technical questions and give and receive feedback. Tweeted about your upcoming release? Ask fellow Art Blocks artists to engage with your content. Collaborate on boosting each other’s visibility. Social media can be emotionally taxing, so use this channel as a space to build supportive and genuine relationships. On Tuesdays at 11 AM CT/12 PM ET, Art Blocks hosts Office Hours via Google Meet. This meeting is an open invitation to chat with other artists and the Art Blocks team face-to-face (or audio-to-audio). With our artist community spread across the world, it can be difficult to connect. This regular meeting is intended to bring artists together to share their work, receive feedback and learn from each other. This meeting can be added to your calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y192a2RxdWluZ3ZsM2EyMmJudWxxZnFkb2sxOEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t). 

**#artist-announcements**
Once artists' projects are scheduled, they can use the #artist-announcements channel to make an announcement for our larger discord audience. This is an opportunity to narrate the story behind the work. For artists additional content (for example, a Medium article or Youtube video), this is a great place to share it. 

**#block-talk**
Block Talk is the water cooler for Art Blocks collectors. Our Community team does its best to keep a good vibe, but as with any high-speed internet forum filled with many passionate contributors, the conversations can fluctuate. Community members respond well to artist input on this channel. It’s also a great way to build name recognition. This is also the place artists will want to spend time during their project release and have a conversation with collectors, enthusiasts and other community members.

**#block-talk // #curated-artist**
#block-talk is the designated area for collector discussions about Presents projects. Artists can use this space to announce their releases and make updates about their projects to collectors. This is especially useful for upcoming exhibitions, updates on physical shipments, and other pertinent information regarding a specific drop. 

Curated artists receive their own channels. Artists can use this space to announce their releases and directly engage with collectors.  

**Twitter**
In addition to participating on the Art Blocks Discord Server, Twitter is a great place to promote artists' projects by tweeting, replying to posts and sharing works in progress. We recommend following other generative artists, collectors and Web3 participants.

**Other Tips**
- Collaborate with an institution or physical gallery to showcase your work
- Create additional materials that give context to artists' work. This could be through a project website, Youtube video, Medium article, etc.


# Mental Health & Social Media 
*As told by Natalie Christensen*

## Tips for managing social media use:
For anyone considering reducing time on social media, there are apps that will help you determine how much time you are currently spending online. 

[This article](https://wethegeek.com/best-apps-to-track-limit-social-media-usage/) from March 2022 recommends the best apps for tracking and reducing time on social media. 

### Make a routine that works for you: 
Pay attention to the emotions you feel when scrolling through social media. If they’re negative (anxiety, jealousy, frustration, or depression) it may not be the best place for you.  Consider removing the apps that bring up this feeling most. Choose an activity that can replace social media at that time – taking a walk, reading a book, breathing exercises, calling a friend,  etc. can be a remedy for these negative emotions.  

For those of us who need to use social media for work, promoting art, etc. it can help to set  specific times of day and a specific amount of time to attend to social media responsibilities and  then set it aside for the day. Set daily limits and stick to it. That may not be easily done but keep setting it as a goal until you  accomplish the daily time limits. Move on to other tasks after the time you allotted for social  media is complete.  
Consider turning off social media notifications so your phone is not distracting you from other  tasks.  

### Other things to consider: 
Sharing parts of your personal story on social media can be risky and uncomfortable. If you  choose to share, do it safely and manage expectations. Tell friends you will be doing this  and ask for feedback before sharing. Ask for their support in the social media space if possible.  

Using social media one hour or less before bedtime can interfere with sleep, the quality of  sleep, etc. Consider keeping your phone in a place away from your bedside. Carefully consider the accounts you follow and consider their purpose and why you think it is important to follow them. If you don’t have a clear answer, consider unfollowing. 

Avoid online arguments or engaging with users you perceive to be negative: 
If you post a controversial opinion, don’t engage if you are attacked or negatively confronted.  Your social media is your own space and defending your work or beliefs constantly is  emotionally depleting. If someone tries to pull you into an argument, remember that kindness is  much more effective than anger.
